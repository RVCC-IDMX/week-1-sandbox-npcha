# Week [#] Knowledge Base Learning Sandbox

## Card Topics

- Card 1: [CSS Gradients: Creating Linear and Radial Color Transitions] - Issue #[22]
- Card 2: [Keyboard Navigation: Building Tab-Friendly Interfaces] - Issue #[50]

## Card 1 Learning Journey

### Experiments Conducted

[I tried both, linear gradients are where the color transition goes down, up, left, right, or diagonally and radial gradients are where the color transition goes out from a central point. For each CSS gradient type, I tried chaning the direction, color stops and blending multiple color. Plus, I also applied gradients to background and bottons to see how they affect UI design.]


### Key Discoveries

[For the linear gradients, I tried several codes, and it worked perfectly fine. It was easy to control and understand how it works because you need to write where you want the color to go and followed by the color. For example, if you want a color from top to bottom, you'll write linear-gradient(to bottom, red, yellow), then it starts red transitioning to yellow. The radial gradients create interesting effects but can be tricky to position. It requires at least two color stops, and color stops are the colors you want to render a smooth transition among. It's quite difficult to understand at first because there are shapes, sizes, and positions that you need to understand to create an interesting effect. For example, the default of radial gradient is evenly spaced color stops; you'll write radial-gradient(red, yellow, green)-this is where all the colors are spaced evenly.]

### Challenges Faced

[There are a few difficulties, and one of them was trying to get the gradient direction and color stop exactly where I want, or look like what I want; it's kinda hard. It is getting more complicated because sometimes the colors blend in unexpected ways or not exactly right, which requires several adjustments.]

## Card 2 Learning Journey

### Experiments Conducted

[I tried making web interfaces by using several attributes and tags such as button, tablist, and summary ]

### Key Discoveries

[Using a button is probably easy because it is straightforward and allows customize freely. Tablist is quite difficult because there are aria-selected, aria-controls, etc. Lastly, I tried a summary, a straightforward like button, easy to easy-to-understand process. I feel like it is similar to buttons. ]

### Challenges Faced

[The only challenges that I faced were establishing because no matter how much I tried or changed my code, the click didn't work. I tried to create two tabs that, when you click them in reveal different text, like if you click tab 1, it says good morning, but if you click tab 2, it says good afternoon.]

## Weekly Reflection

### What concepts clicked for you this week?

[I think the concepts that clicked for me were CSS Gradients because I had used them or learned about them before in my previous class, so I was already familiar with the concept. Also, this time I actually learn more about it, and there is so much more about the gradients in CSS that I didn't know]

### What are you still exploring?

[I definitely still exploring on create a tab because I still don't understand the tablish, I need to know how it actually work. Plus, there is many more way to create a tab interfaces]

### How did AI assistance help your learning?

[I didn't use much AI this time, but it did help me start and give me an idea of what to try]

### What will you do differently next week?

[I will do more research and look for more examples online. Also, try to write code by myself to see which works and which doesn't.]
