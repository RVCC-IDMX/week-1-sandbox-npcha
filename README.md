## Card 1 Learning Journey

### Experiments Conducted

[I tried both, linear gradients are where the color transition goes down, up, left, right, or diagonally and radial gradients are where the color transition goes out from a central point. For each CSS gradient type, I tried chaning the direction, color stops and blending multiple color. Plus, I also applied gradients to background and bottons to see how they affect UI design.]


### Key Discoveries

[For the linear gradients, I tried several codes, and it worked perfectly fine. It was easy to control and understand how it works because you need to write where you want the color to go and followed by the color. For example, if you want a color from top to bottom, you'll write linear-gradient(to bottom, red, yellow), then it starts red transitioning to yellow. The radial gradients create interesting effects but can be tricky to position. It requires at least two color stops, and color stops are the colors you want to render a smooth transition among. It's quite difficult to understand at first because there are shapes, sizes, and positions that you need to understand to create an interesting effect. For example, the default of radial gradient is evenly spaced color stops; you'll write radial-gradient(red, yellow, green)-this is where all the colors are spaced evenly.]

### Challenges Faced

[There are a few difficulties, and one of them was trying to get the gradient direction and color stop exactly where I want, or look like what I want; it's kinda hard. It is getting more complicated because sometimes the colors blend in unexpected ways or not exactly right, which requires several adjustments.]
