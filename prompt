Please create a new repository structure for a weekly learning sandbox. This is for students to experiment with code while creating knowledge base cards.

Create the following structure:

- Root folder with the repository files
- Two empty subdirectories named "card1" and "card2" for student experiments
- A README.md file with a reflection template
- A comprehensive .gitignore file for Node.js web development

For the README.md file, create a template with the following sections:

# Week [#] Knowledge Base Learning Sandbox

## Card Topics

- Card 1: [Topic Name] - Issue #[number]
- Card 2: [Topic Name] - Issue #[number]

## Card 1 Learning Journey

### Challenges Faced

[What was difficult?]

## Card 2 Learning Journey

## Weekly Reflection

### What concepts clicked for you this week?

[Your response]

### What are you still exploring?

[Your response]

### How did AI assistance help your learning?

[Your response]

### What will you do differently next week?

[Your response]

## Notes

[Any additional thoughts, breakthrough moments, or questions]

For the .gitignore file, include comprehensive ignore patterns for:

- Node.js (node_modules, npm debug logs, yarn files)
- Environment variables (.env files)
- OS files (macOS .DS_Store, Windows Thumbs.db, Linux .directory)
- Editor files (VS Code, Sublime, Vim, Emacs temporary files)
- Build outputs (dist, build folders)
- Log files
- Temporary files
- Coverage reports
- Dependency directories
- Cache directories (.cache, .parcel-cache, .next)
- Any compiled output (.css.map, .js.map files)
- .claude, CLAUDE.md
- reports directory

The card1 and card2 directories should be empty but tracked by git (you can add a .gitkeep file in each if needed to ensure they're included in the repository).

This structure allows students to freely experiment in their card directories while maintaining a clean repository structure and documenting their learning journey in the README.
